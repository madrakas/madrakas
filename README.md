## 🖼️ My Background


* I have a degree in physics teaching.
* I have worked in production management for a bit.
* In my previous job I have maintained all IT infrastructure but often ended up programming some tools to ease my colleagues’ routines.
* I have created a few backbone process management applications for my previous company. Did it on MS Access, PHP and MySQL.
* In 2023 I have decided to quit my jobs and went to study in [BIT full stack developer program](https://bit.lt/studijos/full-stack-kursai/). [See what I have learned there](https://github.com/madrakas/madrakas/blob/main/BIT.md).
* In 2024 I have officially finished my studies and am looking for a new party to join for learning and creating some magic together.
